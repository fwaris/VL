VL
=========

VL is an [F#] based DSL for IOS visual layout in [Xamarin] F#-IOS projects.

VL is used to express constraints about the screen layout of controls, e.g. height, width, sequence, spacing, margins, anchoring / docking, etc.

Under the covers VL is translated to the [Apple Auto Layout] visual format language.
